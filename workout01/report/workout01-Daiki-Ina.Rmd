##3) Narrative 

Draymond Green, the Power Forward of Golden State Warriors, was eclipsed in his shooting performance by his teammate in the season of 2016.
Don't get me wrong. Green is an extraordinary black player, but his shooting skills seem indeed questionable. 

If we take a look at "the 2PT Effective Shooting % by Player", Andre Iguodala, Kevin Durant, Stephen Curry and Klay-Thompson
all reached the 50% effectiveness in scoring 2PT shots. Nevertheless, Green finished this season with a meager 49.4% chance of making 2PT shots.The poor capability of Green in shooting "halts the entire offense of the Golden State Warriors as what was once a great opportunity to shoot is now just another pass in the system", according to a Fansided review, ["Golden State Warriors: How bad has Draymond Greenfs shooting been?."](https://bluemanhoop.com/2019/01/10/golden-state-warriors-how-bad-has-draymond-greens-shooting-been/)

Not only is Green underperforming in terms of 2PT shooting, "the 3PT Effective Shooting % by Player" table we have generated is also telling the same story. With regard to 3PT shooting, Green is likewise significantly dwarfed by his co-players in Golden State Warriors, with a lacklustre effectiveness of 31.9%, barely making his way down to below 30%. Green is also behind Andre Iguodala, who is in the fourth place of our table among five Golden State Warriors players with Green being the last, by an astonishing 4.1%.

Of course we can not possibly compare Draymond Green with Klay Thompson, who is one of the best 3PT shooters in NBA, and Stephen Curry, who is frequently considered by fans as one of the greatest 3PT shooters. Notwithstanding the fact that Green is teamed with those great 3PT shooters, his execution of 3PT shootings were not only indecisive but also maladroit. People can potentially argue that it is because other people on the team are too good in terms of 3PT shooting so that Green appears subpar. Still, according to "NBA Player 3-Point Shooting Statistics for PF- 2016-17" on ESPN, Green is the last but one among other players with the same position, with Aaron Gordon, who is a much younger player than Green, being the last. Sadly, Green honestly has a lot of space for improvements as a 3Pt shooter. 

Last but not least, for the "Overall Effective Shooting % by Player", Green also fails miserably in his team by being the last with 42.4% effectiveness, behind Stephen Curry by a considerable 4.3%. To get a visualization of the overall effectiveness of shooting, let's take a look at the "Shot Charts: GSW (2016 Season)", Green's shooting attempts are scarce with highly concentrated and unsuccessful missing shots. Especially around the part of the field under the hoop, Green's missing shots are massive, with the successful shots almost completely overshadowed by the attempts that went awry. In juxtaposition, Green's teammates in Golden State Warriors present relatively well balanced shooting charts.

All in all Green is obviously incompetent in terms of shooting and this inadequacy of him is obtrusively conspicuous alongside his teammates.
Even in 2018, Green's unsatisfactory shooting performance received a great deal of criticism from NBA analysts. An article from "SB Nation" brought to question ["Should Draymond Green continue shooting threes"](https://www.goldenstateofmind.com/2018/12/22/18152009/warriors-2018-draymond-green-three-point-shooting-rotation)?. Although this article went on a defensive side for Draymond Green, it apparently feels stilted and not buttressed by strong arguments. Another piece from "San Fransisco Chronicle" called ["Why Draymond Greenfs shooting woes hurt Warriors more than you might think"](https://www.sfchronicle.com/warriors/article/Why-Draymond-Green-s-shooting-woes-hurt-13492428.php) hints at the insidious harm Green has been bringing to his team. These editorials validate that our analysis of the data coincides with the popular opinion. 

I really hope Draymond Green can surprise us with improving shooting skills in the forthcoming seasons.
